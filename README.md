# Starter Kit  
A starter kit I built, featuring Buzzfeed's Solid CSS framework, an SCSS compiler and Browser Sync. 

## Setup 
Can by installed by running;
`npm install`

## Usage  
Start the development server with the command 
```
gulp
```

## Differences from Master Branch
This is the basic version of my web starter kit, which is what I will use until I learn React and ES6, etc. It uses gulp instead, and has browsersync. 


## Future Additions
For now, this does what I need it to. However, here are some things I will want to add in the future   
- Image Compression
- CSS & JS Minification
- Jade compiling _(if I end up using jade)_  
- Jekyll Build _(If I end up using Jekyll)_ 
- HTML Compression
