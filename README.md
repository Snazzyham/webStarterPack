# Starter Kit  
A starter kit I built while following Andrew Farmer's [Build Your Own Starter Kit](http://andrewhfarmer.com/build-your-own-starter).  

## Setup 
Can by installed by running;
`npm install`

## Usage  
Start the development server with the command 
```
npm start
```

For the moment, it looks exactly like Andrew's did, but I intend to add many things to this and modify somethings as well. I don't really use React so I might get rid of it, and I'm going to find a way to add gulp to this to compile my SCSS files.
